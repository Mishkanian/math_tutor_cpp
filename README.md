# Math Tutor Program

## Description
[MathTutor.cpp](https://github.com/Mishkanian/math_tutor_cpp/blob/main/MathTutor.cpp) is a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. When ran, the program displays two random numbers to be added together. The program will then wait for the student to work on the problem and then show the solution when they are ready.

Below is an example of the program running and waiting for user input:

![math_problem](https://github.com/Mishkanian/math_tutor_cpp/blob/main/README_images/math_problem.png)

After user input, the correct solution is displayed.
